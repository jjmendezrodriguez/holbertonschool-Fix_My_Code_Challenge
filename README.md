# Fix My Code Challenge

This repository contains my solutions for the **Fix My Code Challenge** projects from Holberton School. In this series of challenges, the main goal is to debug and fix existing code. Each challenge involves identifying issues in code and making the necessary corrections to ensure it works as expected.

## About the Project

The **Fix My Code Challenge** is designed to improve debugging skills and enhance problem-solving capabilities. Each task presents a codebase that contains bugs, inefficiencies, or incorrect logic, and my job is to identify and resolve these issues.

### What I've Learned:
- Debugging and understanding other people's code.
- Finding and fixing errors in Python, C, and other programming languages.
- Improving the efficiency and logic of existing codebases.
- The importance of testing and verifying solutions.

## Projects

Some of the challenges in this repository include:
- Fixing bugs in Python scripts.
- Debugging C programs.
- Correcting shell scripts.

Each folder in the repository contains the original buggy code and my corrected version with explanations of the changes I made.
